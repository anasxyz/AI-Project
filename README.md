AI PROJECT REPORT: 
Finding the shortest path to a petrol station of the lowest price, within a limited travel distance considering fuel consumption.

The project is about locating the most cost-effective path to a petrol station of the lowest price, or closest to a user specified price, within a certain travel distance. Each location is either a petrol station, or a non petrol station, and has latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates, by which the distance and fuel consumption between each is calculated.
